### Project Overview:

Star Digital, a prominent multimedia video service provider, embarked on a comprehensive exploration of its digital advertising strategies through an online controlled experiment. The primary focus was to gauge the effectiveness and return on investment for each media investment made. The experiment, spanning six websites, employed a randomized treatment and control group approach, with the treatment group exposed to real promotions and the control group presented with charity advertisements.

### Experimental Design:

The foundation of the experiment lay in a meticulous 90%-10% split of the customer base into treatment and control groups. This split was carefully determined considering factors such as baseline conversion rates, campaign reach, and minimum expected lift. The objective was to ensure a robust statistical foundation and mitigate the potential for endogeneity concerns.

Additionally, the variation in website selection introduced nuances, with different sites incurring varying costs for ad impressions. Some sites charged $25 per thousand impressions, while others charged $20.

### Key Questions Addressed:

#### Effectiveness of Online Advertising:
A linear regression model was employed to scrutinize the impact of online advertising. The analysis revealed that while a directional positive impact favoring the test group was observed, the p-value hovered above the conventional threshold of 0.05. However, with a 90% confidence interval, the effectiveness of online advertising could be tentatively asserted.

#### Frequency Effect on Purchases:
To investigate the influence of frequency on purchase likelihood, a sophisticated linear regression model was executed. The interaction term between the manipulation (test) and total impressions showcased a positive coefficient, signifying that increased frequency positively impacted the test group's likelihood of making a purchase.

#### Site-Specific Advertising Strategy:
The project delved into the strategic decision of choosing websites for advertising. An exhaustive evaluation of Sites 1-6 was conducted, and the analysis considered the varying costs associated with ad impressions. The ultimate question revolved around whether to invest in Site 6 or distribute investments across Sites 1-5.

### Endogeneity Concerns Mitigation:

A comprehensive discussion addressed potential endogeneity concerns, including omitted variable bias, error in measurement, and simultaneity. The randomized test/control assignment and a choice-based split into purchase categories provided a robust framework, minimizing selection bias.

### Conclusion:

Star Digital's online advertising experiment not only shed light on the overall effectiveness of its campaigns but also delved into the nuanced dynamics of frequency effects and site-specific investments. The findings equip Star Digital with valuable insights to refine its digital advertising strategy, optimize return on investment, and strategically allocate resources across different websites. This in-depth analysis forms the basis for informed decision-making in the ever-evolving landscape of online advertising.
